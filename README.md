# SOLID examples

Repository for see examples of SOLID principles

### S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. 

### O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### I – Interface Segregation Principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.

## Targets of SOLID

- Maintanable code
- Easy to change
- Easy to extend
